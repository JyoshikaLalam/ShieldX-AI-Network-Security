## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JyoshikaLalam/ShieldX-AI-Network-Security.git
cd ShieldX-AI-Network-Security
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Place your dataset in the `data/` folder

Use benchmark datasets like `CICIDS`, `KDD99`, `UNSW-NB15`, or your own.

---

## 🚀 Usage

### 🧪 1. Analyze & Train

Launch the Jupyter notebook to explore data and train models:

```bash
jupyter notebook ShieldX_AIML_NetworkSecurity.ipynb
```

### 📄 2. View PDF Report

Open `ShieldX_Network_Traffic_Analysis.pdf` to view charts, metrics, and anomaly insights.

### 🌐 3. Run Web App for Predictions

Start the Flask app:

```bash
python app.py
```

Then navigate to: [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)
Upload a `.csv` file → Get predictions + threat classification.
